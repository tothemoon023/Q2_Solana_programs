Q2 Solana Programs

[Q2_IDenclave(Capstone)](https://github.com/tothemoon023/idenclave) : IDenclave is a privacy-preserving, decentralized identity and credential management MVP built on Solana. It empowers users to create and manage their digital identity, issue and store verifiable credentials, and share zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for trustless verification—all while keeping sensitive data secure and under user control.

*Q2_2025_Enrollnment-dApp * : Turbin3 Part 1 and Part 2 qualifier programs, Q2-2025 (typescript and rust).

[Q2_Solana-ts-NFT ](https://github.com/tothemoon023/Solana_nft_staking) : Create and mint a Metaplex NFT in Solana with Typescript.

[Q2_Anchor-Escrow](https://github.com/tothemoon023/Solana_Escrow) : The Anchor Escrow program enables secure token exchanges between two parties—maker and taker—without relying on a trusted third party.

[Q2_Solana_Amm_Program ](https://github.com/tothemoon023/Solana_AMM): This project implements a decentralized Automated Market Maker (AMM) protocol on Solana blockchain leveraging Anchor framework for robust smart contract architecture.

[Q2_Solana_Escrow_Program](https://github.com/tothemoon023/Solana_Escrow) : The Anchor Escrow program enables secure, trustless token transactions between a maker (initiator) and a taker (counterparty) through blockchain-based smart contracts, eliminating reliance on centralized intermediaries by automating exchange terms and ensuring cryptographic validation.

[Q2_Solana_Vault_Program](https://github.com/tothemoon023/Anchor-vault) : An Anchor-based program leveraging PDAs for trustless SOL management with automated ownership controls. Enables self-custodial deposits/withdrawals through program-derived authority.

[Q2_Solana-Starter_Program](https://github.com/tothemoon023/solana-starter) : Implements Solana's Token Program for creating/managing fungible SPL tokens and NFT minting workflows using Metaplex standards (compressed NFTs, on-chain metadata storage, creator royalty enforcement). Demonstrates token lifecycle management from mint initialization to distribution through programmable CPI instructions.
